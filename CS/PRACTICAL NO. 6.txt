PRACTICAL NO. 6
Aim: Using Sysinternals tools for Network Tracking and Process Monitoring:
A. Check Sysinternals tools. B. Monitor Live Processes. C. Capture RAM-Capture. D. TCP/UDP packets. E. Monitor Hard Disk. F. Monitor Virtual Memory. G. Monitor Cache Memory. Solution:
A. Check Sysinternals tools. =>
Windows Sysinternals tools are utilities to manage, diagnose, troubleshoot, and monitor a
Microsoft Windows environment. The following are the categories of Sysinternals Tools:
1. File and Disk Utilities
2. Networking Utilities
3. Process Utilities
4. Security Utilities
5. System Information Utilities
6. Miscellaneous Utilities
B. Monitor Live Processes (Tool: ProcMon). => To Do:
1. Filter (Process Name or PID or Architecture, etc)
Output:
2. Click on filter > Process monitor filter (filters)
Output:
3: Click on tools > Process tree Output:
4. Click on tools > File summary
Output:
C. Capture RAM (Tool: RAMCapture). =>1. After installing, RamCapturer.exe file. The below window is displayed. Ouput:
2. Click on Capture button. Output:
D. Capture TCP/UDP packets (Tool: TcpView). =>1. Open the Tcpview tool. Output:
2. Right click on any packet > whois ( note: whois only shows when any packets state
is ―established‖ and it is not―listening‖)
Output:
E. Monitor Hard Disk (Tool: DiskMon). =>1: Open the Diskmon tool. Output:
F. Monitor Virtual Memory (Tool: VMMap). =>1: Open the VMMap tool. Select any packet name (eg. atiw.exe) and click OK Output:
2: On clicking OK you can see this window. Output:
G. Monitor Cache Memory (Tool: RAMMap)
1: Open the RAMMap tool. Output:
